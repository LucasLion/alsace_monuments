French Historical Monument Data Processing Script

This Python script processes data on historical monuments in France - Alsace and generates separate CSV files for each arrondissement (administrative district).

Data Source and Output:

    The script assumes the data source is available and handled by the functions in functions.py.
    Modify the script or data source to accommodate different data formats.
    CSV files are generated in the calques directory with names corresponding to the districts (e.g., Altkirch.csv, Strasbourg.csv).

Running the Script:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/french_monument_data.git
    pip install pandas pathlib
    python3 main.py

This will print a confirmation message "fichiers cr√©es" (files created) upon successful execution.

Disclaimer:

The functionality of functions.py is not provided, so the specific data processing logic remains unclear. You might need to adjust the script based on the actual functions and data format.
